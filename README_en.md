# Welcome to the Chem Garden!

This is a collaborative knowledge base created by chemistry students from Zhejiang University who are passionate about building digital gardens while preparing for  their final exams.

## Key Features
- **AI-powered relevance detection**
- **Modular knowledge organization** - Break down concepts into reusable components

## Getting Started
1. Download the source code and extract it
2. Open the folder using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
3. Trust the repository authors when prompted

### Contribution Guidelines
After making edits:
- Create a new branch **or**
- Commit to the pre-branch branch

> ⚠️ Please avoid pushing directly to main branch to prevent merge conflicts

### Technical Requirements
- Basic Git knowledge (the only technical barrier)
- Familiarity with [Markdown syntax](https://pkmer.cn/Pkmer-Docs/50-%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B/markdown/%E6%9C%80%E7%AE%80markdown%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B/)
  - Right-click context menu provides quick formatting options

## Essential Plugins

### Core Functionality
- **Better Word Count**: Tracks document length
- **LaTeX Suite**: Streamlined equation editing
- **Chem**: Renders SMILE into chemical structures
- **Copy Block Link**: Easy  block reference creation (right-click any block)
- **Importer**: Simplifies note migration

> Pro Tips:
> - Use AI tools like Kimi for math/chemical equation recognition
> - For chemical structures: 
>   - ChemDraw → SMILES for perfectionists
>   - Screenshots recommended for efficiency

### Enhanced Presentation
- **List Callout:** (Markdown native syntax preferred)
- **Better Export PDF**:
  - Combine relevant notes using `![[]]` embedding
  - Export unified PDFs for physical review

### Intelligent Connections
Our AI-enhanced modules help build knowledge networks:
- **Various Complements**: Basic algorithm-based similarity matching
- **Smart Connection**: Jina AI-powered semantic vector analysis

### Bonus Feature
We've integrated Deepseek v3 API - use it to query notes and get AI-generated answers!

## Best Practices

### Note Organization
- **Atomic concepts**: Create separate files for individual ideas
  - Linear course content belongs in dedicated files
  - Advanced visualization through Canvas coming soon
- **Metadata matters**:
  - Tags: Broad subject indicators (don't overthink)
  - Document types:
    - `meta`: About the system itself
    - `branch`: Concept variations
    - `trunk`: Core knowledge
    - `thought`: Your learning insights
  - `@author`: Credit your contributions
  - `status`: Indicate completeness (helps prioritize unfinished notes)

### Creative Process
- Check Smart Connections for related content before creating new notes
  - Reduces duplication
  - Strengthens existing knowledge
- All disciplines welcome - not just chemistry!
- Capture spontaneous ideas through [[wikilinks]] - they might blossom later!

### Commenting System
To discuss specific content:
1. Create a new file referencing the target passage
2. Multiple references allowed for comprehensive discussions

Example block reference (click the link icon to navigate):
![[Visualizations#^9ksx0p]]

## Use Cases
1. Exam preparation and study aid
2. Post-class knowledge system construction via Canvas

## Roadmap
- [ ] Standardize note templates (flexible styling, consistent metadata)
- [ ] Beginner-friendly Git tutorial
- [ ] English version documentation
- [ ] Enhanced [[Visualizations]] and interactive query interface
